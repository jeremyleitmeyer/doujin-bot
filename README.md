# Doujin-bot

This is a Discord bot that allows a user to reverse image search a posted image or find images related to a specific tag. (works best for anime/doujin)

## Installation

To use this bot clone the repository and create your own discord app. Use the token from you app where process.env.BOT_TOKEN is and then run it !

## Usage

!sauce takes the last image url or attachment posted in that channel and searches it through saucenao.com's api. !find <tag_name> uses gelbooru to return an image related to the tag name.
